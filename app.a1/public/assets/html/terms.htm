<p>The information provided on the App is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the App from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The App is intended for users who are at least <strong>21</strong> years old and anybody below it is <strong>NOT</strong> permitted to register and/or to use the App.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Ownership &amp; Protection</strong></p>
<p>ESATPT is the creator and technology provider of the App. It utilizes <strong>AB<em>a</em>COS System </strong>(<strong>ABaCOS</strong> for brevity) and <strong>R.E.B.O.S. Technology</strong> (<strong>REBOS</strong> for brevity) to power and run the App. To the exclusion of any other, ESATPT is the sole owner having exclusive rights of the App (less the games played in it), ABaCOS, and REBOS.</p>
<p>All source code, databases, functionality, software, application designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics (collectively, the &ldquo;Contents&rdquo;) of the App, ABaCOS, and REBOS as well as the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained therein (the &ldquo;Marks&rdquo;) thereto are owned or controlled by ESAPT and are protected by utility model, copyright, and trademark laws and various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws of the Philippines, foreign jurisdictions, and international conventions. Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use, no part of the App, ABaCOS, and REBOS and no Content or Marks therein may be copied, reproduced, aggregated, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, distributed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose whatsoever, without the express prior written permission of ESATPT.</p>

L7C has obtained the license from ESATPT to use and utilize the App to run PCSO-approved STL games: Swer2, Swer3, and Pares games, and facilitate betting(s) for the said games (&ldquo;<strong>App Carrier</strong>&rdquo;), for which it represents to have fully secured the approval and/or authorization from PCSO to do so and undertook to fully comply with the agency&rsquo;s regulations for the same, and to be solely responsible for the said compliance. LC7 is fully, completely, and absolutely bound by the intellectual property rights and ownership of ESATPT to the App, ABaCOS, and REBOS, as it claims none of it.</p>

<h3><strong>Delineating ESATPT and L7C</strong></h3>

Apart from the above limited association, ESATPT is not in any way connected to L7C nor is it a part, parcel, essential, partner, co-obligee, co-responsible, co-guarantor, co-maker, and the likes, of said L7C. Moreover, ESATPT, or any of its directors, officers, personnel, and agents, is not operating or co-operating STL games and transactions with L7C using the App, or otherwise.</p>
<p>LC7 is solely and exclusively responsible and liable to PCSO in all its transactions with the said agency being its STL licensee and holds ESATPT and its directors, officers, personnel, and agents, free and harmless from any and all violations, charges, or liabilities whatsoever that might arise from it.
