		<p>The Primary service Pioneer E-Games App has to offer is to provide users the convenient way to play PCSO Swertres without having the need to physically do so at a PCSO outlet which require time, effort and may even costly considering the need for transportation to got to PCSO Outlet just to be able to place a bet on your lucky numbers. Not considering that fact that weather, traffic or even our very limited available time may also be a contributing factor to miss those promising big winnings! Now, you can play Swertres anytime, anywhere!</p>
		<p>The Pioneer E-Games App serves as a third-party services between you (Swertres Players) and PCSO Outlet. The App generates revenue from service charge, Posted Adds and sales from Game Credits.</p>
